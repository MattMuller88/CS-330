How do I approach designing software?


One of the biggest skills/attributes that this class helped me develop was perseverance. While developing my scene, I ran into a lot of issues when it came to applying textures. I seemed to constantly be moving forwards and backwards as I tried different things to fix and apply the shader program. While \nI do not expect to pursue a career in which I work with OpenGL, this experience was still valuable in teaching me a lesson about struggling with coding.

When developing my scene, I could have applied the strategy of iteration a bit more. For example, I could have gone about binding the shader program to my different object meshes using a loop. Developing the code for the final project was a process of constantly building throughout the course. Throughout the milestones I incrementally constructed the objects, implemented interactivity, applied textures, and added lighting to complete the scene.

The skills and experience that I gained in this course can be applied in my future educational/professional pathway if I ever have to work with graphics again. Whether it be OpenGL or another API, I now have a baseline for how visualizations can be developed.
